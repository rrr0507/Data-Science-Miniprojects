    "# Building a Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "In this miniproject, we're going to build an interactive web \"Bus dashboard\" app utilizing NYC's transit data. As such, we'll be focusing on explanatory visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We're going to use [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to power our dashboard. \n",
    "- We'll use [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-gunicorn) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for our web stack.\n",
    "- If you're a Fellow or Scholar, you'll recognize this stack from the 12-day milestone project. \n",
    "- The miniproject contains plenty of room to expermient front-end web technologies such as [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org). If you're comfortable with Bokeh, consider trying these new technologies to broaden your skillset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some of the other miniprojects, this one is a bit less structured. The below outline and sample app are meant as a guideline. If there's a particular direction you'd like to explore with this data, by all means submit some custom visualizations! If you prefer, feel free to visualize the open bus data in your city of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and Plan [Do ASAP: Request Developer Access from MTA]\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use an [Archive of transit data](http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/unofficial-mta-transit-data-archive/resource/106dd52f-8755-40a0-aa3d-dfa6195a8d21) and the [Live Feed](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index/) of MTA Bus data (you'll need to request an API key, stop reading and fill out the form for this now!).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The former is useful for determining overall reliability of a given bus line at a given time/location, the latter is useful for live stop information, of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aside from the archived bus time data, also extremely useful is the [GTFS data](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) in the Archive (under the `gtfs` folder). This includes scheduled departure times, route information, stop ID locations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Want a pre-filtered dataset to play with some visualizations? We've got you covered.\n",
    "`s3://dataincubator-course/viz-miniproject/manhattan.csv` contains 7 days' of nicely filtered data joined to some basic stop information.\n",

    "## An overview of the data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Data\n",
    "The historical archive of data includes archives of real-time bus information (positions for each bus at a given time) as well as schedule data for each bus trip. It's a little messy. If you're using our dataset, you can use the following snippet to quickly load the data with datetime indices."
